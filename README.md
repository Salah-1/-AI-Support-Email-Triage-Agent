# AI Support Email Triage Agent (AI Bot for incoming emails)

##  Overview
## For the impatient: look at the /src/ folder

This project implements an intelligent AI agent designed to monitor high-volume support email inboxes (e.g., `support@example.com`). The agent automatically triages incoming messages based on their content, and routes them to the appropriate internal teams for timely response/action. This significantly streamlines the support workflow, reduces manual effort, and improves response times.

##  Key Features

✅ **Automated Email Monitoring:** Continuously watches the designated support inbox for new messages.

✅ **Intelligent Triage:** Utilizes AI, powered by Langchain, to analyze email content and determine the nature of the request/issue.

✅ **Contextual Understanding:** Leverages Langchain's memory capabilities to maintain context for more accurate triage.

✅ **Q&A Capabilities:** Employs Langchain's Q&A features to potentially answer common questions or clarify routing needs internally.

✅ **Automated Routing:** Sends the triaged email or relevant information to predefined teams or systems based on the analysis.

✅ **API Accessible:** Core functionality is exposed via a well-defined API for integration and interaction.

✅ **Multi-Cloud Deployment Ready:** Designed with deployment across major cloud platforms in mind.

##  Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

*   **Develop Core Logic:** Build the email processing and triage agent using Python and the Langchain framework, specifically utilizing its memory and Q&A components.
*   **API Enablement:** Deploy the agent's functionality and make it accessible through a robust API endpoint.
*   **Multi-Cloud Deployment & Learning:** Successfully deploy the solution across various cloud environments and document the processes involved:
    *   Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    *   Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker
    *   Microsoft Azure AI

##  Technology Stack

*   **Core Language:** Python
*   **AI Framework:** Langchain
*   **Deployment Platforms:**
    *   API Hosting (e.g., FastAPI, Flask on a server/serverless function)
    *   GCP
    *   AWS SageMaker
    *   Azure AI

##  High-Level Workflow

1.   **Email Arrival:** A new email arrives in the monitored support inbox.
2.   **Agent Retrieval:** The AI Agent fetches the new email.
3.   **Content Analysis:** Langchain processes the email content, leveraging memory and Q&A capabilities for context and classification.
4.   **Triage Decision:** The Agent determines the appropriate team, category, or required action based on the analysis.
5.   **Routing:** The Agent forwards the email, relevant details, or a task notification to the designated team/system via API calls or other configured integrations.

## ☁️ Deployment Strategy

This project aims for flexibility and learning cloud provider differences by targeting deployment across multiple cloud providers:

*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Deployment steps and configuration specific to GCP services (e.g., Cloud Functions, Vertex, AI Platform). See /src/gcp/
*   **AWS SageMaker:** Integration and deployment leveraging AWS SageMaker for hosting the AI model and potentially other components (e.g., Lambda). See /src/aws/
*   **Azure AI:** Deployment within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem using Azure AI services (e.g., Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Search ). See /src/azure/

*(Detailed deployment guides for each platform will be added as they are developed.)*
